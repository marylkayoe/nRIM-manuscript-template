# WORKFOLDER

This folder is meant to hold all kinds of plots and figures (e.g., from scripts, other sources) that are considered to be part of the manuscript

Please be mindful of the following guidelines:
- Name files descriptively so that it is clear which figure each file is related to
- Include source files (not just screenshots!)
- Be mindful of file size
-
